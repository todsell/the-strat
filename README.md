# Overview
------
TheSTRAT is a trading method developed by Rob Smith (@RobInTheBlack).  

### Candlestick Overview
Before beginning you have to have a basic understanding of candlesticks.  Candle sticks have 5 basic parts.  
* WICKS
  * 1 - Top wick / high / very top of the candle
    * The highest price the stock trading during the given time frame of the candlestick
  * 2 - Bottom wick / low / very bottom of the candle
    * The lowest price the stock trading during the given time frame of the candlestick
* FILL
  * 3 - Open
    * The price of the stock at the open of the given time frame (top or bottom of the fill depending on the color, more below)
  * 4 - Close
    * The price of the stock at the close of the given time frame (top or bottom of the fill depending on the color, more below)
  * 5 - Color
    * Green / Hollow / Empty
      * 3/4 The open was lower than the close, it opened at the bottom and closed at the top (price went up)   
    * Red / Black / Full
      * 3/4 The open was higher than the close, it opened at the bottom and closed at the top (price went down)
* Example

### STRAT PART 1 - Candles and Pricing Action
  * 1 Candle
    * Names: 
      * 1 Candle / Inside Bar / Inside Action / Consolidation / Sideways
    * Technical:
      * Occur when the current candle falls completely within the prior candle
    * Meaning:
      * Balance, equilibrium, buyers and sellers agree on price, no one is in control, trying to determine where price is going next
    * Detail:
      * Never trade a one bar, wait for the consolidation to stop then it's time to get into a trade
    * Example
      * ![OneBar](docs/OneBar.jpg)
  * 2 Candle
    * Names: 
      * 2 Candle / Directional Bar / 2 Down / 2 Up
    * Technical: 
      * Occur when the current candle takes out one side of the prior candle
        * A 2 down means it took out the previous candle's low, but failed to take out the high
        * A 2 up means it took out the previous candle's high, but failed to take out the low
    * Meaning: 
      * Sellers are selling it down or buyers are buying it up but not both, a 2 can turn into a 3, but never a 1 
    * Action: 
      * The market trades in the direction of the most 2's, but only trade 2's with continuation
    * Example: 
      * ![TwoUpBar](docs/TwoUpBar.jpg) ![TwoDownBar](docs/TwoDownBar.jpg)
  * 3 Candle
    * Names: 
      * 3 Candle / Outside Bar / Discovery Candle / Mother Bar
    * Technical: 
      * Occur when the current candle takes out both sides of the prior candle
    * Meaning: 
      * Price discovery starting over, buyers willing to buy it up, sellers willing to buy it down, choppiness
    * Action: 
      * Never trade a mother bar, price discovery is happening, wait for further confirmation one way or anther
    * Example:
      * ![StratCheatSheet1](docs/ThreeBar.jpg)


### STRAT PART 2 - Other Factors
* Time Frame Continuity
  * Price direction is best determined when looking at multiple time frames rather than lagging indicators or moving averages
  * When all time frames point in the same direction in either direction, or Full Time Frame Continuity, is the ideal trading situation
  * Example: 
    * ![StratCheatSheet1](docs/FTC_Up.jpg) ![StratCheatSheet1](docs/FTC_Down.jpg)
* Broadening Formations 
  * Simplest explanation is = it's a compound 3 bar
    * Lower lows and higher highs
    * Can draw this anywhere on any time line
    * Just pick a high, draw the line to a higher high
    * Pick a low, draw a line to a lower low
    * Bars should be more FLAT than not, otherwise mostly inside action (which is fine, but if you are looking for trends start flatter)
  * Increasing price volatility and diagrammed as two diverging trend lines, one rising and one falling
  * It usually occurs after a significant rise, or fall, in pricing action
  * It is identified on a chart by a series of higher pivot highs and lower pivot lows.
  * Directional bars and outside bars that fit into a triangle and ultimately lead to reversals or expansions and present trading opportunities
  * Picture: 
    * ![StratCheatSheet1](docs/BF_Sample.jpg)

### START PART 3 - Actionable Signals
* Hammer
  * Candle that looks like a "hammer"
  * Little to no top wick, open and close are very close to the top of the wick, 75% of the candle is mostly wick at the bottom
  * Action: 
    * Entry as soon as the next candle breaks above the top, or top, wick of the previous hammer candle
  * Picture:
    *  ![StratCheatSheet1](docs/Hammer.JPG)
* Shooter / Shooting Star
  * Candle that looks like a "shooter" / upside down hammer
  * Little to no bottom wick, open and close are very close to the bottom of the wick, 75% of the candle is mostly wick at the top
  * Action: 
    * Entry as soon as the next candle breaks below the bottom, or bottom wick, of the previous shooter candle
  * Picture: 
    * ![StratCheatSheet1](docs/Shooter.JPG)
* Inside Bar
  * Inside bar (explained above)
  * Action: 
    * After price is done consolidating it will break up or down, take the break at the top or the bottom of the previous inside candle depending on which way it goes  

### STRAT PART 4 - Misc
* PMG - Pivot Machine Gun
  * A very fast moving upwards or downwards candles taking out previous highs or previous lows
  * As the prior candles are "taken out" it causes those investors to go the other way, reinforcing the direction of the bar even more taking out even more highs or lows
  * Picture: 
    * ![StratCheatSheet1](docs/PMG.JPG)
* TTO - Triangle They Out
  * Inside action on a larger timeframe
  * As consolidation is happening, things will get "tighter" toward a point and eventually break out up or down and go fast
  * Picture:
